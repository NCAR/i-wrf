The `I-WRF weather simulation framework <https://i-wrf.org>`_ from the
`NSF National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) <https://ncar.ucar.edu/>`_ and the
`Cornell Center for Advanced Computing <https://cac.cornell.edu/>`_ provides
instructions for running the `Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) <https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf>`_
model and the `METplus <https://dtcenter.org/community-code/metplus>`_ verification framework.

This User's Guide includes several use case examples for running I-WRF using the
`Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ or `Apptainer <https://apptainer.org>`_
containerization software on NSF NCAR High Performance Computing (HPC) platforms,
Cornell HPC, or on a user workstation.
