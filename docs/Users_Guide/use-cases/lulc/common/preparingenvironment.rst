  With your instance created and running and you logged in to it through SSH,
  you can now create the run folders, install Docker software and download the data to run the simulation and verification.
  You will only need to perform these steps once,
  as they essentially change the contents of the instance's disk
  and those changes will remain even after the instance is shelved and unshelved.

  The following sections instruct you to issue numerous Linux commands in your shell.
  If you are not familiar with Linux, you may want to refer to
  `An Introduction to Linux <https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/Linux>`_ when working through these steps.
  The commands in each section can be copied using the button in the upper right corner
  and then pasted into your shell by right-clicking.
