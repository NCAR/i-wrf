Land Use/Land Cover Change
==========================

Scientific Objective
--------------------

The Land Use/Land Cover Change (LULC) use case examines how changes in land surface characteristics impact weather patterns and atmospheric dynamics through idealized modeling scenarios. METplus provides statistical analysis and evaluation tools to quantify these meteorological impacts, making this verification workflow valuable for studies in urban meteorology, land-atmosphere interactions, and climate change impact assessment.

Version Added
-------------

Update section with the version of i-wrf this use case was added to.

Datasets
--------

Update section content to describe the datasets used to run WRF and METplus.

Running This I-WRF Use Case
