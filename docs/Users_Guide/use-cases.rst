Running I-WRF Containers
************************

This chapter provides instructions to demonstrate configuring and running I-WRF on
various platforms for a variety of scientific use cases. The :ref:`use-case-matthew`
use case is the simplest and serves as a great starting place. Users are encouraged
to run each use case with its default settings before proceeeding to the customization
options described in :numref:`customization`.

Note that this :ref:`use-case-template` should be used when developing new use cases.
