Use Cases
*********

This chapter provides sample use cases to demonstrate configuring and running I-WRF on
various platforms. The :ref:`use-case-matthew` use case is the simplest and serves as a
great starting place. Users are encouraged to run each use case with its default settings
before proceeding to the customization options described in :numref:`customization`.

Note that this :ref:`use-case-template` should be used when developing new use cases.
