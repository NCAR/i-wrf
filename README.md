This repository contains the source code for the Integrated End-To-End WRF (I-WRF) Containerized Framework.
The [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)](https://www.mmm.ucar.edu/models/wrf) model is a state of the art mesoscale numerical weather prediction system.

Please see the [I-WRF website](https://i-wrf.org) and the [I-WRF User's Guide](https://i-wrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users_Guide/index.html) for more information.

We encourage users to follow the instructions in the [I-WRF User's Guide](https://i-wrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users_Guide/index.html) to run I-WRF and provide feedback.
The [Hurricane Matthew use case](https://i-wrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users_Guide/use-cases/matthew.html)
is a good starting point, as it is a relatively short simulation.
The [Land Use Land Cover use case](https://i-wrf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Users_Guide/use-cases/lulc.html) is a more complex simulation.

Support for I-WRF is provided through the [I-WRF Discussions](https://github.com/NCAR/i-wrf/discussions) forum.
Users are welcome and encouraged to answer or address each other's questions there!
